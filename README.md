## Software Testing Course - Baloot Project

This repository provides a set of projects used in a Software Testing course to explore various testing techniques for Baloot, an e-commerce system built using Spring Boot with a RESTful API. 

**Course Overview:**

The course is structured around six computer assignments (CAs), each focusing on a specific testing approach. By completing these projects, you'll gain practical experience in:

- **Unit Testing:** Writing tests for individual components using JUnit.
- **Test Doubles:** Simulating dependencies with Mockito to isolate units under test.
- **Graph-Based Testing:** Analyzing code coverage with JaCoCo to identify potential gaps.
- **API Testing:** Validating the behavior of RESTful APIs.
- **Mutation Testing:** Assessing test effectiveness by introducing faults.
- **GUI Testing:** Interacting with the user interface using Katalon Recorder.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Defining test scenarios in a human-readable format using Cucumber.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Unit Testing with JUnit:**
   - Add unit tests to the Baloot e-commerce project.
   - Learn about JUnit framework and test creation.

2. **Test Doubles with Mockito:**
   - Use Mockito to create test doubles and simulate interactions.
   - Understand the concept of dependency injection and isolation.

3. **Graph-Based Testing with JaCoCo:**
   - Calculate branch and statement coverage using JaCoCo.
   - Analyze code coverage to identify potential areas for improvement.

4. **API Testing:**
   - Test the functionality of Baloot's RESTful APIs.
   - Learn about API testing tools and techniques.

5. **Mutation Testing with PIT and CI with GitHub Actions:**
   - Improve test quality by introducing mutations and checking coverage.
   - Implement continuous integration using GitHub Actions to automate testing.

6. **GUI Testing with Katalon Recorder and Behavior Driven Development with Cucumber:**
   - Test the user interface of Baloot using Katalon Recorder.
   - Write behavior-driven tests using Cucumber to describe desired outcomes.
